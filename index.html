          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p id="p_poverty">Poverty has the most direct correlation with the three metrics of poor health. States with higher poverty rates
            also have higher rates of obesity and smoking but lower rates of healthcare coverage.</p>

          <p id="p_age">Age has the least correlation with the three metrics of health. Median age does have a negative correlation with healthcare coverage.
            However, it has no correlation with obesity, and it would have none with smoking if Utah were removed (it may be considered an outlier for low drug
            usage given the high rate of Mormonism.)</p>

          <p id="p_income">Income naturally has the opposite correlations as poverty; although the correlations are marginally less strong.
            Obesity and smoking rates decrease with income, but healthcare coverage increases.</p>
